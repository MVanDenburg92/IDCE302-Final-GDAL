### Data must have spatial aspect.
Supported formats:
- **Raster:** GeoTiff, JPEG, Erdas Imagine, DTED, and more
- **Vector:** ESRI Shapefile, ESRI ArcSDE, ESRI FileGDB, KML, PostGIS, and more

## Uses of GDAL:
Coordinate system conversion, statistics, format conversion, geo operations, image merge, etc. 

Two interfaces: API or command line
### 1. GDAL API:
- Library with classes and functions
- Input and output of spatial data, as well as other functions including reprojection, resampling, stretching, and more.
### 2. GDAL Command Line (Terminal)
Common commands:
- ``` Gdalinfo ```: raster data and metadata querying 
- ``` Gdal_translate ```: raster data format conversion, clipping, scaling
- ``` Gdalwarp ```: raster data reprojection, resizing, clipping, and mosaicing 
- ``` Ogrinfo ```: vector data and metadata querying
- ``` Ogr2ogr ```: vector data format conversion, merging, reprojecting, clipping, etc

## Download Process:
